EXPECTED CHALLENGES & MITIGATION STRATEGIES
==========================================

Access & Availability Challenges
Senior Practitioner Time Constraints:
- Challenge: Senior practitioners have limited availability and high demands on their time
- Mitigation Strategy: Flexible scheduling with multiple time options, shorter interview alternatives, and written questionnaire options for practitioners preferring asynchronous communication
- Backup Plan: Focus on recently published thought leadership from busy practitioners with targeted follow-up questions rather than comprehensive interviews

Professional Network Limitations:
- Challenge: Limited existing connections to senior transparency implementation experts
- Mitigation Strategy: Strategic professional association engagement, LinkedIn premium networking tools, and referral-based expansion from initial practitioner contacts
- Backup Plan: Increased emphasis on published practitioner sources (regulatory comments, case studies) with systematic analysis methodology

Response Rate & Engagement Quality
Unsolicited Outreach Response Rates:
- Challenge: Low response rates from cold outreach to senior practitioners
- Mitigation Strategy: Highly personalized outreach with clear value proposition, professional association introductions, and referral-based networking
- Backup Plan: Alternative practitioner identification through professional conference attendance and industry event networking

Generic vs. Specific Implementation Insights:
- Challenge: Practitioners may provide general advice rather than specific implementation experience and quantified outcomes
- Mitigation Strategy: Structured interview protocol with probing questions for specific examples, implementation timelines, resource requirements, and measurable results
- Backup Plan: Follow-up written questionnaires targeting specific implementation details not captured in initial interviews

Timeline & Resource Constraints
Academic Calendar Limitations:
- Challenge: Academic timeline may not align with practitioner availability and comprehensive research requirements
- Mitigation Strategy: Early outreach initiation, multiple simultaneous practitioner engagement, and efficient interview scheduling with rapid documentation turnaround
- Backup Plan: Extended reliance on published practitioner sources with systematic analysis supplementing limited interview opportunities

Research Scope vs. Depth Trade-offs:
- Challenge: Balancing comprehensive practitioner coverage with deep implementation detail from fewer sources
- Mitigation Strategy: Tiered approach focusing on high-quality interviews from most credible practitioners while maintaining broader coverage through published source analysis
- Backup Plan: Concentrated focus on 2-3 highly credible practitioners with extensive implementation experience supplemented by systematic case study analysis

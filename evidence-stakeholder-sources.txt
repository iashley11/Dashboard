Stakeholder Analysis Framework Application

Stakeholder Identification Process
According to Smith (2000), stakeholders are "individuals and organizations 
who are actively involved in the project, or whose interests may be 
positively or negatively affected as a result of project execution or 
successful project completion." For corporate information withholding 
problems, this includes:
- Those who can become "winners" or "losers" as result of transparency initiatives
- Intermediaries in execution of information sharing solutions
- Those who can make claims on attention or resources
- Stakeholders with their own objectives that may conflict with transparency goals

Stakeholder Interest Analysis
Smith's framework identifies that stakeholder interests often include:
- Overt vs. hidden interests related to project objectives
- Interests that change as projects move from beginning to ending phases
- Multiple conflicting interests within same stakeholder groups
- Requirements for specific information at specific times within project lifecycle
- Political and involvement requirements with key players

Critical Success Factors for Stakeholder Engagement
- Setting aside time at project outset to identify and document stakeholder 
requirements and their impact
- Understanding not only internal project environment but external entities 
and interfaces
- Developing potential coalitions of support and reducing impact of opposition
- Designing communication strategies that address stakeholder information 
needs and preferences
- Managing and influencing stakeholder expectations throughout project lifecycle

Risk Factors Related to Stakeholder Management
- Stakeholders with high influence holding negative interests toward 
transparency initiatives
- Conflicting needs and expectations among different stakeholder groups
- Unspecified stakeholder roles and responsibilities creating confusion
- Different risk tolerances among stakeholders affecting solution acceptance
- Changing stakeholder interests during different phases of implementation

Implementation Framework for Information Withholding Context

Stakeholder Categories for Corporate Transparency
Based on Smith's framework, corporate information withholding stakeholders include:
- Senior Leadership: High influence stakeholders who control transparency 
policy decisions
- Middle Management: Intermediary stakeholders who implement information 
sharing practices
- Employees: End-user stakeholders affected by information access and 
communication quality
- Information Technology: Support stakeholders enabling transparency systems
- External Partners: Stakeholders affected by corporate communication transparency
- Regulatory Bodies: External stakeholders with compliance and oversight interests

Stakeholder Requirements Assessment
Smith's approach requires analyzing three defining elements for every stakeholder:
1. Requirements: What each stakeholder needs from transparency initiative
2. Influence: Stakeholder's relative power over and within transparency implementation
3. Importance: Degree to which success depends on addressing stakeholder 
needs and expectations

Organizational Evidence: Internal Data Collection Strategy
Comprehensive approach to gathering internal evidence on information withholding impacts

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================
This organizational evidence collection strategy employs a systematic Data→Information→Evidence transformation methodology to quantify information withholding behaviors and assess intervention readiness. Using the 10 Barriers Framework, we identify individual, organizational, and external barriers while collecting baseline metrics across performance, trust, and operational efficiency domains.

EVIDENCE COLLECTION FRAMEWORK
=============================

Primary Objective
Quantify the extent and organizational impact of information withholding behaviors, including performance gaps, knowledge sharing resistance patterns, and trust deficits affecting organizational communication effectiveness and decision-making capacity.

Secondary Objective  
Assess organizational readiness and capacity for transparency intervention implementation, including current system capabilities, cultural change readiness, resource availability, and leadership support for communication improvement initiatives.

10 BARRIERS FRAMEWORK APPLICATION
=================================

Individual Level Barriers (Barriers 1-4)
1. Knowledge/Awareness: Assess employee understanding of information sharing protocols
2. Skills: Evaluate communication competencies and knowledge transfer abilities
3. Professional Behavior: Measure information hoarding vs. sharing behavioral patterns
4. Motivation/Beliefs: Analyze attitudes toward transparency and collaborative information sharing

Organizational Level Barriers (Barriers 5-8)
5. Team Functioning: Examine departmental communication effectiveness and knowledge flow
6. Resources: Assess technology, time, and personnel capacity for transparency initiatives
7. Organization: Evaluate structural and cultural factors affecting information sharing
8. Political/Policy: Analyze leadership support and organizational policies supporting transparency

External Level Barriers (Barriers 9-10)
9. Social/Economic: Consider industry norms and economic pressures affecting information sharing
10. Legal/Regulatory: Assess compliance requirements and regulatory constraints on transparency

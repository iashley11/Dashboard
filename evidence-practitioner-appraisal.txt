CONFIDENCE LEVEL ASSESSMENT
===========================

High Confidence Recommendations (Strong Cross-Practitioner Consensus)
Based on strong consistency across practitioner evidence:
1. Provide adequate context with all shared information to prevent stakeholder misinterpretation and enable informed decision-making
2. Implement phased approach with pilot testing before full rollout to validate approaches and refine implementation strategies
3. Secure executive leadership commitment and sustained support throughout implementation to ensure resource allocation and cultural change success
4. Plan for 12-18 month minimum timeline for cultural change and full adoption based on organizational change management requirements
5. Focus on meaningful rather than comprehensive information disclosure to optimize stakeholder understanding and implementation efficiency
6. Leverage existing oversight and communication mechanisms rather than creating parallel systems to maximize adoption and minimize disruption

Medium Confidence Recommendations (Reasonable Support with Context Considerations)
Reasonable support but some uncertainty regarding context-specific adaptation:
1. Target disclosure to stakeholders best positioned to understand and use information effectively (professional services recommendation may require adaptation for different corporate contexts)
2. Invest significantly in stakeholder education and ongoing support (specific resource requirements may vary significantly by organizational context and stakeholder sophistication)
3. Establish two-way communication mechanisms rather than one-way information sharing (implementation approaches may need significant adaptation to organizational culture and existing communication patterns)

Low Confidence or Conflicting Areas (Limited Evidence or Conflicting Recommendations)
Areas requiring additional evidence or context-specific adaptation:
1. Optimal balance between transparency and competitive information protection (limited specific guidance for corporate contexts with competitive sensitivity)
2. Specific approaches for addressing cultural resistance beyond general change management principles (need for more detailed implementation strategies)
3. Long-term sustainability approaches beyond initial implementation period (limited evidence on maintenance and evolution of transparency practices)
4. Approaches for smaller organizations with limited resources for systematic implementation (most evidence from large organization contexts)
